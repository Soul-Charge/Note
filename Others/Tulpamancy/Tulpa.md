### 一封公开信 Posted byu/AlynAndRiver✨Estrogen Star System✨ (mixed origins)3 years ago

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/83n0a0/an_open_letter_to_jade_ufordaplot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/83n0a0/an_open_letter_to_jade_ufordaplot/)

#### 原文

Dear Jade, (/u/foradaplot)

Alyn: I am stunned. We are disappointed and saddened to the point that it is difficult to find the proper words to express how we feel. I feel as if I cannot allow myself to feel the proper depth of my feelings because it would be too painful.

I decided that I would share these thoughts about you on r/tulpas because after the decision was made to remove you from this community because of your bad behavior, I wanted my friends here to know a different side of you. I'm not asking anyone to change their mind. I just wanted everyone to know the wonderful things you've created and what you've thrown away.

When I first saw the "Draw My Life" video you and Aury made (with the help of your female friend, of course), I felt an immediate fraternity with you because I felt as if your suffering was quite similar to mine, if not exactly the same. I thought, "Here's another kindred soul who suffered unnecessarily at the hands of people who hated him because he is different."

And so I wrote to you to express how I felt when I watched your videos. As the weeks and months passed by, I was really impressed at how eloquently you expressed yourself and how you worked to present tulpas in a way that more people could understand and accept.

The conversation that we shared helped tremendously to bring me healing and relief from much of the painful emotional baggage I carried with me. You helped me force River, and you helped River care for me.

River: Yes, you most certainly did. You sent the two of us on a very special journey together where I helped turn around some of his most deep-seated negative attitudes towards himself. I can't thank you enough for that.

Alyn: You helped River and I together unpack and come to terms with some of my most powerfully repressed painful memories.

Jade, you're part of the reason that my treasured companion River is here with me today!

And then, we got to meet you in person so River actually had someone she could speak to openly as a tulpa. What an amazing experience! How proud it made me feel as a tulpa creator and how happy it made River to be able to come out!

As I watched you put out more and more videos, I anticipated that with your wisdom, insight, and raw passion, you would become a pillar of r/tulpas. I can hardly believe that you took the potential to fill that role and let it go.

I listened to you as you told me about all the drama that unfolded between you and your family and friends as you struggled to find your way in life as you were pressured into an unwanted course of university study. Since this is a public letter, I'm not going to air out your dirty laundry here beyond what's already been put out, but I want to tell you again that I carefully listened to you and as you know, I tried hard to support you in the ways that I could.

We really cared about you, Jade.

You told us again very clearly that you cared about me when you cautioned me to stay away from the hypnopony community. I'm very glad for having receiving that advice from you.

I don't know what's next for you, Jade.

You created one of the best tulpa Discords, and even tho I was not a member, your reputation tells me that you created one of the best hypnosis Discords, and then you were removed from both. Plus, your YouTube channel is gone. I know that you poured so much into creating these things.

The saying keeps coming to mind: "You cannot save anyone. You can only love them."

I tried really hard, Jade.

We cared about you. We loved you.

How utterly disappointing that now we have to be concerned with protecting ourselves from you.

(Mods, if you want to remove this, go ahead. It won't hurt my feelings.)

亲爱的Jade, (/u/foradaplot)

#### 译文：

Alyn：我很震惊。我们感到失望和悲伤，以至于难以找到合适的词语来表达我们的感受。我觉得自己无法让自己感受到适当的感情深度，因为那会太痛苦。

我决定在r/tulpas上分享这些关于你的想法，因为在因为你的不良行为而决定将你从这个社区中删除之后，我想让这里的朋友们知道你的另一面。我并不是要求任何人改变自己的想法。我只是想让大家知道你创造的美好事物和你丢掉的东西。

当我第一次看到你和奥里制作的 "画出我的生活 "视频时（当然是在你的女性朋友的帮助下），我立刻感觉到了与你的兄弟情谊，因为我觉得你的苦难与我的苦难即使不完全相同，也相当相似。我想，"这又是一个亲情的灵魂，他在那些因为他的不同而恨他的人手中遭受了不必要的痛苦"。

于是我给你写信，表达我看你视频时的感受。随着几周和几个月的时间过去，你如何雄辩地表达自己的观点，如何努力以一种更多的人能够理解和接受的方式来呈现图尔卡斯，真的给我留下了深刻的印象。

我们分享的对话极大地帮助我从我身上背负的许多痛苦的情感包袱中得到了治愈和解脱。你帮我逼迫河，也帮河关心我。

河。是的，你肯定没有。你把我们两个人一起送上了一段非常特别的旅程，在那里，我帮助他扭转了一些对自己最深层的消极态度。我不知道怎么感谢你才好。

Alyn：你帮助River和我一起解开了我最强大的压抑的痛苦记忆，并接受了这些记忆。

玉，你是我的珍爱的伙伴河今天能和我在一起的原因之一!

然后，我们见到了你本人，这样河河就真的有了一个可以作为一个图尔巴人公开说话的人。什么是一个惊人的经验！多么自豪，它让我觉得作为一个tulpa的创造者，它是多么幸福，它让河能够出来！。

当我看着你放出越来越多的视频，我预料到你的智慧，洞察力，和原始的激情，你会成为r/tulpas的支柱。我很难相信，你把有潜力填补这个角色的人给放走了。

当你告诉我你和你的家人和朋友之间发生的所有戏剧性事件时，我听了你的讲述，因为你被迫进入一个不受欢迎的大学学习课程，你努力寻找你的生活方式。由于这是一封公开信，除了已经放出的内容，我不会在这里晾晒你的脏东西，但我想再次告诉你，我认真地倾听了你的心声，你也知道，我努力用我能做到的方式支持你。

我们真的很关心你，杰德。

当你告诫我远离催眠社区的时候，你再次非常清楚地告诉我们，你关心我。我很高兴能从你那里得到这样的建议。

我不知道你的下一步是什么，玉。

你创建了一个最好的图尔巴讨论区，尽管我不是成员，但你的名声告诉我，你创建了一个最好的催眠讨论区，然后你从这两个讨论区中被删除了。另外，你的YouTube频道也消失了。我知道你为创造这些东西倾注了很多心血。

有句话一直在我脑海中浮现 "你无法拯救任何人，你只能爱他们 你只能爱他们。"

我真的很努力了，杰德

我们很关心你 我们爱你

多么令人失望的是，现在我们不得不关心如何保护自己免受你的伤害。

(版主，如果你想删除这个，请便，不会伤害我的感情)

Hey Alyn, River, Dante, and Rocky. Long time since we spoke.

I suggest you not be quite so disappointed in Jade here. Jade has a really strong tendency to self destruct. I knew this going in to my relationship with Jade, and I knew that this would happen for sure.

I guess it's very possible that the reason I'm so upset with people in this community over this issue is not that what is being said is false. It's that everyone is surprised about it. I guess I expected people to be more aware about what was going on, and to be more understanding. Compassion and empathy are impossible without this awareness.

So, I guess from my perspective, Jade is not a bad girl, because I knew from the very beginning who Jade was and what was going to happen. Others in this community feel a sense of fear, a sense of violation, a sense of losing control. Understandable emotions when someone turns out to be someone you didn't think they were.

In this case, you should not blame Jade. The pony hypnosis community, and, to a much lesser extent, the tulpa community, has a number of systemic issues. I went into these communities aware of these issues and intending to try and fix them. Jade joined these communities and adopted their culture, norms and practises.

I understand that the events that followed seem completely surprising and out of character for Jade. But that's because very few people would be able to understand the culture of the pony and pet hypnosis communities.

Jade was indeed a scientist in the tulpa community. Because this is part of our culture. And she was a hypnotist in the pony hypnosis communities. Because it is part of their culture.

Jade indeed did want to be a hypnosis cult leader. Because there was a market for such things in that community. But she had neither the capability or understanding to ever have been able to pull such a thing off successfully.

I knew all these things from day one. My perspective is very different from that of everyone else, it seems.

我建议你在这里不要对Jade那么失望。杰德有很强的自我毁灭倾向。我知道这一点，在我和Jade的关系中，我知道这肯定会发生。

我想很有可能，我之所以在这个问题上对这个社区的人如此不满，并不是因为说的是假话。而是大家对这件事感到惊讶。我想，我期望大家能更清楚地了解事情的真相，能更多地理解。如果没有这种意识，就不可能有同情心和同理心。

所以，我想从我的角度来说，小玉并不是一个坏女孩，因为我从一开始就知道小玉是谁，会发生什么。这个社区里的其他人会感到恐惧感、被侵犯感、失去控制感。当一个人变成了一个你不认为是的人时，这种情绪是可以理解的。

在这种情况下，你不应该责怪小玉。小马催眠社区，以及在更小的程度上，图帕社区，有很多系统性的问题。我进入这些社区时意识到了这些问题，并打算尝试解决它们。Jade加入了这些社区，并采纳了他们的文化、规范和做法。

我明白，随后发生的事件似乎完全出乎意料，也不符合玉的性格。但那是因为很少有人能够理解小马和宠物催眠社区的文化。

玉确实是图帕社区的科学家。因为这是我们文化的一部分。而她是小马催眠社区的催眠师，因为这是他们文化的一部分。因为这是他们文化的一部分。

玉确实想成为催眠邪教的领袖。因为在那个社区里，这样的事情是有市场的。但她既没有能力也没有理解力，无法成功地完成这样的事情。

我从一开始就知道这些事情。看来，我的观点和大家的观点很不一样。

Hi Tulpa and War, we were actually thinking of reaching out to you because we know that you've been very close to Jade, probably quite a bit closer to her than us. She shared a lot intimately with us regarding some things, but she urged us to stay away from the hypnopony community.

We suspect you see an innocent naivity in us. In regards to some things, that is probably an accurate viewpoint, but in others, not so much. We have been well aware for quite some time that Jade has some serious issues. We tried to treat her with compassion and empathy, but it seems as if what she needs is beyond what we can provide, as earnestly as we tried. We feel disappointed in ourselves that we could not guide her away from the path to self-destruction. Jade had so much incredible potential she laid waste to. It is like she took a beautiful crystal chandelier that she herself had painstakingly assembled over years and just shattered it. Words fail to describe the sadness we feel.

It was clear to us from the beginning that Jade's issues were not caused by the tulpa or hypnosis communities; her issues have been in the making her entire life for reasons you may know better than we do. We have believed that Jade is a beautiful, talented, and worthy person who ended up making some serious mistakes because of the issues she has.

But back to your first paragraph, Jade is not the first person we've heard of self-destructing. We understand that she has endured much abuse and trauma (which we feel that she understated to us). We don't understand the connection exactly, but we do know that damaged people often develop compulsive self-destructive behaviors. One theory is that people compulsively self-destruct because of a deep-seated self-hate that they express by destroying themselves, but that's just a theory. Tulpa, surely, you must know of people in her life past and present who would have incubated such a self-hatred in her, don't you?

River here contemplates her title as "Goddess of Love" and ruminates that some people are very hard to love.

In short, we feared that something bad was going to happen and we hoped that by virtue of our support for Jade, it could have been prevented, but it sounds as if you loved Jade even whilst being certain that this would happen.

###### 译文

嗨，Tulpa和War，其实我们一直在考虑联系你们，因为我们知道你们和Jade的关系非常密切，可能比我们更接近她。她和我们亲密地分享了很多关于一些事情，但她劝我们远离催眠社区。

我们怀疑你在我们身上看到了一种纯真的天真。对于某些事情，这可能是一个准确的观点，但在其他方面，就不是那么回事了。我们已经意识到玉有一些严重的问题，已经有一段时间了。我们试图用同情心和同理心来对待她，但似乎她所需要的东西超出了我们所能提供的范围，尽管我们已经很努力了。我们对自己感到失望，因为我们无法引导她远离自我毁灭的道路。玉有那么多不可思议的潜力，她却浪费了。就像她把自己多年来辛辛苦苦组装的一盏美丽的水晶吊灯，就这样打碎了。言语无法形容我们的悲伤。

从一开始，我们就清楚地知道，玉的问题不是由图尔帕或催眠社区造成的；她的问题在她的整个生命中都在酝酿，原因你们可能比我们更清楚。我们一直相信Jade是一个美丽的、有才华的、有价值的人，但因为她的问题而最终犯了一些严重的错误。

但回到你的第一段，玉不是我们听说的第一个自我毁灭的人。我们理解她经历了很多虐待和创伤（我们觉得她向我们低估了这些）。我们不明白这两者之间到底有什么联系，但我们知道，受损的人往往会产生强迫性的自我毁灭行为。有一种理论认为，人们之所以会强迫性地自我毁灭，是因为根深蒂固的自我仇恨，他们通过毁灭自己来表达，但这只是一种理论。图帕，你肯定知道在她过去和现在的生活中，有哪些人会在她身上孵化出这样的自恨，对吗？

淼淼在这里思考着自己 "爱的女神 "的称号，反思着有些人是很难爱的。

总之，我们担心会有不好的事情发生，我们希望凭借我们对小玉的支持，可以避免这种事情的发生，但听起来，你爱小玉的同时，也肯定会发生这种事情。

To a degree, it is the responsibility of every person to get their own sh*t together. In this particular situation, I'd like to point out a strange and bizarre aspect of human psychology.

It is possible to fall into a dependency relationship where a person is controlled by needing to offer constant help to another.

I suggest you don't feel bad for having been unable to offer sufficient support. I'm pretty sure you, and over ten other people have gone way beyond the call of duty here. Some people just don't accept help.

***

I know what you are talking about. Unfortunately that's private and confidential information.

The compulsive self-destruction you refer to, I don't prefer that theory because it is of a subconscious nature, and this suggests, it could be just as easily be a misinterpretation of maladaptive behaviour a person cannot fix. Maladaptive behaviours are a very common side effect of social isolation and abuse. The fact that depression is also a very common side effect of these will always result in a correlation between self hate and self destructive behaviour.

Yeah, I do love her.

***

I do see naivity in a lot of members of the community. I think I'm just becoming an old grumpy academic. Jaded, perhaps, by stubborn strong willed friends.

*rolls around and flutters wings playfully*

###### 译文

在某种程度上，每个人都有责任把自己的事情处理好。在这种特殊的情况下，我想指出人类心理学中一个奇怪而诡异的方面。

有可能陷入一种依赖关系，一个人需要不断地给另一个人提供帮助，从而被控制。

我建议你不要因为无法提供足够的支持而感到难过。我敢肯定，你和其他十多个人在这里已经超出了职责范围。有些人就是不接受帮助

***

我知道你在说什么 不幸的是，这是私人和机密的信息。

你所说的强迫性自我毁灭，我不喜欢这种理论，因为它是一种潜意识性质的，这说明，它同样可以是一个人无法修正的适应不良行为的曲解。适应不良行为是社会孤立和虐待的一个很常见的副作用。事实上，抑郁症也是一个非常常见的副作用，这些总是会导致自我仇恨和自我毁灭行为之间的相关性。

是的，我确实很爱她。

***

我确实在很多社会成员身上看到了天真。我想我只是变成了一个脾气暴躁的老学者。也许是被固执的意志坚强的朋友们所厌倦了。

*滚来滚去，俏皮地扑打着翅膀。*

## 注释

  对于我来说，视频的作者发生了什么根本不重要，无需在意他这个系列的视频被删除了，我只管翻译就行，因为这视频能让我学到我想学的事物，但是，在一些难以翻译的地方，我认为我必须获得更多关于作者的信息，比如他有几个tulpa，只有Aury还是还有可能名为"Mod"的tulpa，因为在2p中他说了my tulpas，Aury and M? 所以为了翻译我必须获得关于他的信息。
  不过嘛...说是这么说，但是老毛病还是改不了，对于为什么删视频和youtube号，为什么Tulpa.info上搜Ford只有一个看似是拥有他视频资源的匿名分享者，他怎么了，这些我还是会在意的。
